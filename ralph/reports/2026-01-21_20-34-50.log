[2026-01-21 20:34:50] [INFO] ========== Task 1/3 ==========
[2026-01-21 20:34:50] [INFO] Executing task: AUTH-001
[2026-01-21 20:34:50] [INFO] Title: Email verification flow
[2026-01-21 20:34:50] [INFO] Task AUTH-001 status updated to: in-progress
I need write permissions to continue with the implementation. The file `/root/Boss-of_clean-2/lib/email/verification.ts` needs to be created to proceed with the email verification flow implementation. Please grant write permissions so I can create the necessary files and complete the AUTH-001 task.
