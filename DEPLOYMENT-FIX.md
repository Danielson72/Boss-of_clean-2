## üöÄ MANUAL DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

**IMPORTANT**: Your FREE tier code is ready but needs to be pushed to GitHub for Netlify to deploy it.

**Current Status:**
‚úÖ FREE tier added to pricing page  
‚úÖ All build errors fixed
‚úÖ Changes committed locally  
‚ùå Changes NOT pushed to GitHub yet

**Quick Fix - Upload to GitHub:**
1. Go to https://github.com/danielalvarez/boss-of-clean
2. Click 'Upload files' 
3. Drag these files from your local folder:
   - app/pricing/page.tsx (contains the FREE tier)
   - lib/stripe/config.ts 
   - lib/stripe/subscription-service.ts
   - lib/services/searchService.ts
4. Commit message: 'Add FREE tier and fix build errors'
5. This will trigger Netlify deployment automatically

**Alternative - Fix Git Authentication:**
Run: gh auth login
Then: git push origin main

**Result:** FREE tier will appear at https://bossofclean2.netlify.app/pricing
