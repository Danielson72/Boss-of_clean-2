## 🎯 KEY SUCCESS CRITERIA

1. **Hero Section Preserved**: Cat CEO image and branding EXACTLY as designed
2. **Functional Buttons**: Search and signup buttons actually work
3. **Authentication**: Login/signup process functional
4. **Search Engine**: Results page loads and handles queries
5. **Professional Appearance**: Business-ready visual design
6. **Mobile Ready**: Responsive across all devices

## 🚨 KNOWN LIMITATIONS (Without Supabase Connection)
- Authentication won't persist (needs real Supabase credentials)
- Search results will be empty (needs database with cleaner data)
- User registration won't save (needs database connection)

## 🎉 READY FOR NEXT STEPS
Once local testing passes, we can:
1. Set up Supabase database with real credentials
2. Deploy to Netlify
3. Add sample cleaner data for demonstration
4. Implement Stripe payment integration
5. Add customer/cleaner dashboards
