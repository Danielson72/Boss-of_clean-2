# üñºÔ∏è Hero Image Replacement Guide

## üéØ **Current Issue:**
The hero image is too zoomed in, showing only the cat CEO's face instead of the full professional office scene.

## üé® **Ideal Hero Image Requirements:**

### **Scene Composition:**
- **Full cat CEO** sitting professionally in executive chair behind desk
- **Complete office setting** with desk, computer, papers, business items
- **City skyline visible** through large windows in background  
- **Professional lighting** that's not too dark or bright
- **Wide aspect ratio** (landscape orientation)
- **High resolution** (at least 1920x1080)

### **Style Requirements:**
- **Professional business atmosphere**
- **Clean, modern office design**
- **Good contrast** for text overlay
- **Not too busy** - text needs to be readable over it

## üîß **Quick Fix Options:**

### **Option 1: AI Image Generation (Recommended)**
Use these prompts in AI image generators like:
- **DALL-E 3** (ChatGPT Plus): https://chat.openai.com
- **Midjourney**: https://midjourney.com  
- **Leonardo AI**: https://leonardo.ai

**Prompt:**
```
Professional business cat CEO sitting behind executive desk in modern office, full body shot, city skyline visible through large windows, clean corporate environment, natural lighting, wide shot showing complete scene, high resolution, photorealistic style, suitable for website hero banner
```

**Alternative Prompt:**
```
Wide shot of orange tabby cat in business suit sitting at executive desk, modern corporate office with floor-to-ceiling windows showing city skyline, professional lighting, clean composition, website banner format, 16:9 aspect ratio
```

### **Option 2: Stock Photo Replacement**
Search for professional business/office stock photos on:
- **Unsplash**: https://unsplash.com (free)
- **Shutterstock**: https://shutterstock.com (paid)
- **Adobe Stock**: https://stock.adobe.com (paid)

**Search Terms:**
- "professional office city skyline"
- "executive desk office windows"
- "modern business office interior"
- "corporate office cityscape background"

### **Option 3: Photo Editing**
If you have photo editing skills:
- Use the existing cat image
- Composite it into a proper office background
- Add city skyline through windows
- Adjust lighting and positioning

## üìÅ **Implementation Steps:**

### **1. Get New Image:**
- Generate or download your chosen hero image
- Save as: `hero-office-wide.jpg` or similar
- Recommended size: 1920x1080 or larger

### **2. Add to Project:**
```bash
# Copy image to public folder
cp your-new-image.jpg /Users/danielalvarez/Desktop/Boss-of_clean-2-main/public/images/hero-office-wide.jpg
```

### **3. Update Homepage:**
Replace line 62 in `app/page.tsx`:
```javascript
// Old:
backgroundImage: "url('/images/ChatGPT Image Aug 5, 2025, 05_04_11 PM.png')",

// New:
backgroundImage: "url('/images/hero-office-wide.jpg')",
```

### **4. Adjust Positioning:**
Update line 63:
```javascript
// Old:
backgroundPosition: 'center 20%'

// New:
backgroundPosition: 'center center'
// or
backgroundPosition: 'center top'
```

## üé® **Alternative: CSS-Only Fix**

If you want to keep the current image but show more of it:

```javascript
// In app/page.tsx, line 61-64:
style={{
  backgroundImage: "url('/images/ChatGPT Image Aug 5, 2025, 05_04_11 PM.png')",
  backgroundPosition: 'center center',
  backgroundSize: 'contain',  // or 'cover' but zoomed out
  transform: 'scale(0.8)'     // Zoom out effect
}}
```

## üöÄ **Recommended Quick Solution:**

1. **Go to ChatGPT Plus** (if you have it)
2. **Use this exact prompt**:
   ```
   Create a wide professional office scene with a business cat CEO sitting behind an executive desk. Show the full cat, complete desk setup, and city skyline visible through large windows. Make it suitable for a website hero banner. Wide format, high resolution.
   ```
3. **Download the generated image**
4. **Save as** `/public/images/hero-professional-office.jpg`
5. **Update the homepage** with the new image path

This will give you a much better hero image that shows the complete professional scene instead of just the close-up face! üéä
